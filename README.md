# Ayesha's Portfolio

## 🍥 Overview

A clean, responsive personal portfolio website built with React, Tailwing CSS, and Vite. It intends to showcase my projects and work experience, while providing a little bit of an introduction to who I am!
This is the first site I have made fully from scratch and I continuously return to make edits and improvements.
